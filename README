Purpose:

Provide a python library that allows for basic creation and editing of OpenIOC
objects.  It supports a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for various
items:

    item                Create  Read    Update  Delete
    IOC name            Yes     No      Yes     Yes
    IOC description     Yes     No      Yes     Yes
    created date        Yes     No      Yes     N/A
    last modified date  Yes     No      Yes     N/A
    published date      Yes     No      Yes     N/A
    link metadata       Yes     No      Yes     Yes
    IndicatorItem nodes Yes     No      NotYet  Yes
    Indicator nodes     Yes     No      NotYet  Yes
    Parameters          Yes     No      Yes     Yes

Items do not have built in Read operations, since all items can be accesed
with built in ElementTree syntax or the use of XPATH to select portions
of the IOC.
    
No decision has been made about whether or not to support changing of
existing Indicator/IndicatorItem nodes.

See the Docs in the Docs\ directory, and the examples directory for examples of
working with the library.  The user code should only be calling functionality
provided in ioc_api or ioc_common.

===============================================================================
